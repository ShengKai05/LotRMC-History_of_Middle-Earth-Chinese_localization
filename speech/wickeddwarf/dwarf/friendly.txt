Our women are so alike in voice and appearance that they are often mistaken for our men.
Roaring fires! Malt beer! Ripe meat off the bone!
Oi lad, Welcome to the Red Mountains!
Let us drink together!
Shall we drink, #?
Dwarven ale is the finest drink in all Middle-earth!
The wealth of the Dwarves is surpassed by no other race.
There is some good stonework here.
What tidings do you bring from the world of dwarves, #?
My beard is the envy of all Orocarni.
You need to work on that beard, #.
The smith-skill of the Dwarves is unmatched!
Do you have news from our folk in the West?
Welcome to the red mountains, #! Many riches await you here.
Heil to the mighty king!
We are the richest dwarves of middle-earth!
I fight for my king!
Oi!
What ye want!?
