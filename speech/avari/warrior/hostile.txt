By the star of Eärendil, I swear I shall see you slain!
You are not welcome in Moriquendi!
You are not welcome in Moriquendi, #!
Flee these lands, #!
For Moriquendi!
No longer shall you corrupt these lands, #!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Leave this land, or face the edge of our blades!
I will not allow evil to taint the realm of Moriquendi. You shall soon meet your doom, #.
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
