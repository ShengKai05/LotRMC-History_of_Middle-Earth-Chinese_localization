I would rather die than give you any of these weapons!
You will have nothing from me but your doom, #!
Leave or face the wrath of Moriquendi!
I will not allow you to taint my gleaming armour with your foul hands!
Begone or face the wrath of our kin!
You will meet your doom before you get any of my weapons!
