You will have to prove your allegiance to our kin if you wish to make use of our mighty blades, #.
Your presence is still young in my mind. You have not yet proven yourself to our kin.
Only a true Elf-friend may wield our mighty weapons!
You will have to prove yourself if you wish to wield our weapons.
The smith-skill of my kin is full of ancient lore and skill...
If you wish to wield our mighty weapons, you will have to do more for our kin.
You are not yet worthy enough to be entrusted with our bows and blades.
You must prove yourself to our kin if you wish to trade with me.
