You are not welcome among the Elves, #.
the Moriquendi is no friend of yours.
Those such as myself do not hold those such as yourself in high regard.
You are no friend of the Quendi; that much is plain to see.
Were you to set foot in Moriquendi, I guarantee you would regret it, #.
I share neither silver nor the craft of Elves with the likes of you.
Begone, friend of the enemy!
I should rather die than give you any of my goods!
