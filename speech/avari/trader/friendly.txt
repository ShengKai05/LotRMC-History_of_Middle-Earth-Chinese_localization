Greetings from the land of Moriquendi, #!
The treasures of Moriquendi may be bought for silver coins.
If you desire Elven crafts, I could exchange something for silver coins.
Do you wish to trade, #?
Greetings, #. Perhaps you have something to trade?
I am a Elf of the folk of the Moriquendi.
I bring you the craftwork of the Elves of Moriquendi!
Mae govannen, #! Do you wish to trade with me?
