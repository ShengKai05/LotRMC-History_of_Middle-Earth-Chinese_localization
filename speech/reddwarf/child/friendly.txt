Welcome to the Red Mountains, #!
Have you met my father Yet?.
Greetings!
One day I'll be able to drink Dwarven ale. I can't wait!
Can you pass me some Dwarven ale while nobody's looking?
How are you, #?
Raarrrgghh!
They say I'm too young to hunt Orcs! Ha!
I wish I could wear my father's armour...
I will have a great beard one day!
There is no weapon finer than a Dwarven axe, #!
One day I shall fight the enemy with my father!
