Moonlight drowns out all but the brightest stars.
Miruvor! Refreshes the body and cleanses the spirit.
It is easy to lose oneself among our folk.
Are you an Elf-friend, #?
No enemy shall enter the realm of Eregion.
You cannot call yourself a true Elf-friend until you have tasted lembas, #.
I have seen years of the sun beyond the count of mortal Men.
May the stars of Elbereth guide you!
May the winds of Manwë show you the way!
A star shines on the hour of our meeting, #.
May the leaves of your life tree never turn brown, #!
Novaer.
Namárië.
I amar prestar aen, han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han noston ned wilith.
That what should be shall be.
Some things that should have not been forgotten were lost.
A star rises out of the darkness.
Hail, Eärendil, brightest of stars!
We have never see the two trees!
Days of fight are over to our own realm! 
The history of the avari is dark!
Cursed by the valar, we will never see the rest of Middle-Earth!
