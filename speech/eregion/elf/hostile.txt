Who are you?
#, you may not set foot in Eregion!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you in the dark.
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no Elf-friend, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Eregion!
You may not be here, #!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, friend of the enemy!
You bring great corruption here, #. You can go no further.
You will take no elves more! Hostile creature! Go back to the shadow!
You want to start a war in the avari realms?
