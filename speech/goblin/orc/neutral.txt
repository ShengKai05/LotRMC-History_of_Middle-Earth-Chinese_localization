I smell Man-flesh!
I've had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
What are you after, maggot?
Follow your orders, scum!
You don't look like a Goblin-Man!
Do you want something?
Don't just stand there! Do something!
I don't trust you, maggot!
Whom do you serve?
Move along, scum!
Are you trying to start a fight?
You stink!
You smell like a rotten maggot!
I don't trust you, filthy maggot!
Get out of my sight, worm!
Get back to work, scum!
