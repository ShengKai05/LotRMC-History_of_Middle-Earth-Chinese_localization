Trying to start a skirmish?
Nobody touches me, you filthy maggot!
I'll skewer you like a piece of meat!
You trying to start something?
I'll have your guts for garters, scum!
What are you looking at me like that for, scum?
I'll have your head on a spike, maggot!
I'll bleed you like a stuck pig!
Looks like it's time for a skirmish!
Nobody skirmishes with me and gets away with it!
You looking for a skirmish, filthy maggot?
Let's see you look at me like that with my blade stuck through you!
You asking for a skirmish?
Who are you calling a filthy maggot?
You after a scuffle, scum?
Want a fight, you filthy piece of meat?
I'll make dinner out of you, maggot!
You think you can beat me, filth?
You shall pay for that, you filthy worm!
I'll squish you like the filthy little worm you are!
You'll be dinner once I'm done with you, maggot!
