Filthy maggot! Oh, it's you, #...
I seek Man-flesh!
Where is the Man-flesh?
What do you want?
You still don't look like a Goblin-Man, #!
I've had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
Maggoty bread again? Give me some Man-flesh!
I can't wait to get my teeth into some Man-flesh!
At your service, #!
What are you after?
The air is foul here.
We shall break their bones and feast on their flesh!
We shall swarm into the lands of enemy like a plague! Leave nothing alive!
These rags stink!
Ruin! Ruin to the enemy!
Something smells disgusting here. It's you, #! Go away!
Man-flesh!
If you can get me some Man-flesh, I won't eat you instead! Ha! Ha!
