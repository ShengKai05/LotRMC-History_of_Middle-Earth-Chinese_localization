Where's the nearest Man-flesh? I'm starving here!
What are your orders, my lord?
You may be my commander, #, but you're still a filthy maggot!
I smell Man-flesh!
Lead us to war, #!
The air is ripe with the stink of fear!
I've had nothing to eat but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
The enemy shall fall before our might!
Death! Death to all who oppose us!
Shall we hunt some Man-flesh, #?
My stomach is dying for Man-flesh!
I am ready to hunt some Man-scum.
Death to the enemies, and all their allies!
Let us wreak havoc upon the enemy!
