Hmm...
Hmmph...
In these parts, it is very difficult to find anyone at all who wants to share in an adventure.
Eldest, that’s what I am. Mark my words, my friends
I was here before the river and the trees
I remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. 
I made paths before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. 
I was here before the kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. 
When the elves passed westward, I was here already, before the seas were bent. 
I knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless – before the Dark Lord came from Outside.
Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! Ring a dong! hop along! Fal lal the willow! Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!
Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling! Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight, Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight, There my pretty lady is, River-woman's daughter, Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water. Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing? Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! and merry-o! Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away! Tom's in a hurry now. Evening will follow day. Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing. Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?
Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle! Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle. Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping. When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow. Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow! Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you. Hey now! merry dol! We'll be waiting for you!
Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties! #! Ponies all! We are fond of parties. Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!
