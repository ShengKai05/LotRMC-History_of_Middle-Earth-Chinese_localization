You are a half-wit and a fool!
To think that it should have come to this!
Do you not remember my name?
Fool! Ah, #, you old fool!
It is never too late to turn from the path of the Shadow.
You have walked upon some most unwise roads.
Such wickedness ill-befits one of your high station!
Even for one so deep in folly as you, there is hope.
Turn away from your folly!
Cast aside your vain ambition and return to the right path!
