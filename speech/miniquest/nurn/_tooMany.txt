You have already sworn to help others, #.
Remember the promises you made to my brothers and sisters.
You are too busy. I will ask no more of you.
It would not be good of me to burden you with even more tasks, #.
I can see you are already busy with tasks, #.
Have you not already pledged to help others of my kin?
You are gracious to offer me help, #, but you would be better to remember the promises you made to others.
It would not be wise to give my tasks to one who has forgotten their promises.
No, #. I shall ask no more of you.
Aren't you busy with others, #? I cannot ask more of you.
Others have asked for your help, #, and you have promised it. You should remember that.
I can ask no more of you while you let your promises go forgotten.
